## Description

_{Specifications:
  1: Intakes a number input by the user on a form (5 for example)

  3: Checks if numbers divisible by 5 (in this case 5 is, so replaces with "pong")
  4: Checks if numbers divisible by 3 (3 is, so replaces with "ping")
  5: Returns numbers printed in list format counting from 1 up to the number chosen by user, with appropriately substituted "pings, pongs, and ping-pongs." }_
